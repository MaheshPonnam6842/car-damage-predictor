# Car Damage Prediction APP
A Streamlit web application that uses a deep learning model (ResNet50) to classify car damage from uploaded images.
Since the model is trained primarily on third-quarter front and rear views, it performs best when the uploaded images follow similar perspectives.
Uploading side views or close-up damage images may lead to less accurate predictions. For optimal results, use images showing the full front or rear at a slight angle.
